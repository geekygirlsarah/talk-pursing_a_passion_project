# Pursuing a Passion Project: Struggles and Sucesses

## Abstract
In 2016, I had a variety of small ideas that ended up combining together into a new project: Finding a way to amplify the voices of the underrepresented groups in tech. I decided to start off with a podcast. After 7 months of fighting technology, fighting life battles, and fighting imposter syndrome, I released the first episode.

Along the way, I’ve learned a lot of things about connecting with people and communities, pursing my passions, and starting a very large project. I will share how I went from a vague idea to creating and releasing this new media to the public. I’ll also talk some of the technical aspects that I go through to pull off an average episode of the show. Finally, you’ll see how ultimately my passion drove this project to success.
